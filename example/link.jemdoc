# jemdoc: menu{MENU}{link.html}, nofooter
== Underscore Example

You can control the behavior of a link by putting a slash (+\/+) character at the beginning of the link address or not: by putting a slash, you can make the link open in the current web broswer tab.  

For example, [mathjax.html \[mathjax.html\]] opens in a new web broswer tab, but [/mathjax.html \[\/mathjax.html\]] opens in the same web browser tab.  The link opening in a new tab is useful for linking an external website (like [http://www.google.com]), wherease the link opening in the same tab is useful for liking your jemdoc page (such as the page linked as a +jemdoc+ menu item on the left panel).

A +jemdoc+ menu item on the left panel opens in the same tab by default, but you can make it open in a new tab by putting a backslash (+\\+) character in the beginning of the link of the menu item.  This is useful to link an external website as a menu item.  See this usage in "Open in New Tab" menu item on the left panel, which is defined in MENU file.
