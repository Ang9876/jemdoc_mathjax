This example/ directory contains jemdoc source files that create an example website that demonstrates the new features that I added to the original jemdoc.  To build the website, execute the following command in this example/ directory:

../jemdoc -c mysite.conf *.jemdoc

This generates a few HTML files, which you can open in any web browser to see the results.  

MathJax configuration is done in mysite.conf.  Change mysite.conf to control the behavior of MathJax.

I implemented the new features only for my convenience, so in the development I focused on "making them just work".  Therefore, the modification is messy and probably contains lots of errors.  Hopefully in the future the original jemdoc developer will agree on the usefulness of those features and spend some time himself to figure out how to adopt them in the official jemdoc release in an elegant way :-)
